Technology Used
The technology I used in my project are the following:

Java\ Eclipse
SQL \ wampserver
JSF


Eclipse
Is defined as a platform that has been designed for building integrated web and application development tooling. The design of the platform doesn’t have a lot for the user in functionality and design, the overall platform promotes rapid development of integrated system features based upon plugins. It delivers a UI/ user interface mode with working tools. It can handle and run numerous OS/ operating systems despite the fact offering a strong integration operating system. Eclipse offers multiple plugins and APIs which are supported on its operating system. Eclipse has a very dynamic architecture structure for discovery, loading and running of their plugins. The platform handles the logistics of finding and running the right code. The platform UI provides a standard user navigation model. Each individual plugin can concentrate on their appointed task(s). Their task are mainly testing, animating, publishing, compiling, debugging and much more.

Java
Java is a general purpose, high level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It was initially started back in 1991 and originally called OAK, at the time it was created it was designed to handheld devices. It was developed in 1995 for the budding new World Wide Web\Internet and it changed its name to java. Is defined as an Object-Oriented Language and it is very like C++, the source code files with a .java extension are compiled into a format called bytecode files with a .class extension.

WampServer
It is a web development platform on windows that allows you to make dynamic web applications with Apache, PHP and of course mysql. The wampserver automatically installs everything you need to develop databases and web applications.

MySQL
Is most popular and in demand open source SQL database management systems and was acquired by Oracle back in January 2010 which is developed, distributed and supported by their corporation now. MySQL is a relational database which stores data in separate table instead of placing all the data in one big unordered table. Its database structures are organized to optimize for speed in the physical layer. The logical layer deals with tables, views and rows and columns. Also, it’s software is open sourced. The MySQL Database Server is very fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to use.
